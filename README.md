# utility-meter-mqtt

A project for reading usage metrics from your utility's smart meter and
publishing usage data to an MQTT broker. It uses
[rtlamr](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr) to read data from an SDR receiver
and [mosquitto_pub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html) to publish
messages to MQTT. It requires a compatible rtl-sdr dongle, such as the [NooElec
Nano 2+](https://www.amazon.com/NooElec-NESDR-Nano-Ultra-Low-Compatible/dp/B01B4L48QU).
